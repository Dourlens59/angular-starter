## Prerequisites

He was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.17. <br>
Before you begin, make sure your development environment includes __Node.jsÂ®__ and an __npm package manager__.

__Node.js__ :

Angular requires Node.js version 10.9.0 or later.
* To check your version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
* To get Node.js, go to [nodejs.org](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

__Npm package manager__ : 

Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as [npm packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/index.html).
 
To download and install npm packages, you must have an npm package manager.

This setup guide uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command line interface, which is installed with __Node.js__ by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a terminal/console window.

## Installation

Clone this project using the command :
``` 
  git clone git@github.com:adeo/scvs-pltf--starter-angular.git
```
Switch to the development branch using
``` 
  git checkout -b develop
```
Install all the dependencies :
``` 
  npm install
```

## Run application with a development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build Application 

Run `npm build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
